##### About

This is a collection of Matlab scripts that can help with using [SPM](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/) and [FSL](http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/). These scripts are also available from [my lab website](http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/CRNL/tools/spm8-scripts) which includes a brief description about each script.
